 * @brief System clock frequency (core clock)
 *
 * The system clock frequency supplied to the SysTick timer and the processor
 * core clock. This variable can be used by the user application to setup the
 * SysTick timer or configure other parameters. It may also be used by debugger to
 * query the frequency of the debug timer or configure the trace clock speed
 * SystemCoreClock is initialized with a correct predefined value.

 * @brief Setup the microcontroller system.
 *
 * Typically this function configures the oscillator (PLL) that is part of the
 * microcontroller device. For systems with variable clock speed it also updates
 * the variable SystemCoreClock. SystemInit is called from startup_device file.

 * @brief Updates the SystemCoreClock variable.
 *
 * It must be called whenever the core clock is changed during program
 * execution. SystemCoreClockUpdate() evaluates the clock register settings and calculates
